# Unity Bike Racer Game

## Project Overview
This is an endless runner game built with Unity 3D, where the player controls a bike and navigates through an ever-generating environment. The goal is to achieve the highest score by surviving as long as possible.

## How to Play / Download the Game

Since the game build is larger than GitHub's direct upload limit, you can download the playable game build from the link below:

### Running the Game (for Ubuntu/Linux users):

1.  **Download the `.zip` file** from the link above.
2.  **Unzip the downloaded file** (e.g., `MyBikeRaceGame_Build.zip`). This will extract a folder (likely named `my game build` or similar).
3.  **Navigate into the extracted folder.**
4.  You will find an executable file named `MyBikeRaceRaceGame.x86_64` (or similar, ending in `.x86_64`).
5.  You might need to give it executable permissions:
    * Open your terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T).
    * Navigate to the folder where `MyBikeRaceRaceGame.x86_64` is located (e.g., `cd /path/to/my/game/build/`).
    * Run the command: `chmod +x MyBikeRaceRaceGame.x86_64`
6.  **Run the game:** Double-click on `MyBikeRaceRaceGame.x86_64` or run it from the terminal: `./MyBikeRaceRaceGame.x86_64`

## Dependencies / Requirements

* **Unity Player:** Your system needs to have the necessary Unity runtime dependencies. These are usually included within the build, but on Linux, ensuring your system has standard graphics drivers and libraries is important.
* **Operating System:** Built for Linux (Ubuntu 64-bit).

## Development (Optional - if you want to share source code later)
* This project was developed using Unity 2022.3 (LTS) - *Adjust Unity version if different*
